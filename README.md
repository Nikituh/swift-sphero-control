## BB-8 CONTROLLER

Proof of concept application that lets you control [BB-8](http://www.sphero.com/starwars/bb8) over the internet (websockets).

The app connects to BB-8 via bluetooth, has a basic UI to test controls and implements [PubNub](https://www.pubnub.com/) library in order to receive near real-time commands via websocket to control the sphero robot.
